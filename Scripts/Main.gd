A lost cherub, a new companion to our journeys perhaps, but a clumsy one, and a wingless form for the moment. LUCIFIER, I be, a sojourner, of the sons of God as you may be. Experiencer of that perhaps divine cataclysm hours past, thrice the mountain rung and oft ground shook and snow fell. I say again, who might you be, fellow?'
